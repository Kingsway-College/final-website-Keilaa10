        What Is Central America?
    </h2>  
    
    <p>
        Central America is described as a narrow region which connects North America to South America. Central America consist of 7 total countries, Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. In this website I will be talking about 3 of these countries(Costa Rica, Guatemala, El Salvador). Central America is sorrounded/bordered by the Pacific Ocean(to the west) and to the east the Carribean Sea. This region has very diverse ecosystems, which include rainforest, mountains, and even volcanoes. It is open about its indigenous and spanish colonial history, which blends Mayan, Aztec, and european influences.

    <p>
        For most countries in Central America they are able to make money through agriculture. They are able to sell coffee, bananas, and sugar. They are also able to make money through tourism. Central America has two official languages as 6 countries official language is spanish while Belize is the only country whos official language is English. Another things to note is that in a lot of countries like these they face many challenges like political instability, poverty, and like many countries natural disasters, however they have growing economies and vibrant cultures which tends to be what attracts tourists.
